Problem Statement
There are two 100 - story buildings, called A and B. (In this problem, the ground floor is called the first floor.)
For each i=1,…,100, the i -th floor of A and that of B are connected by a corridor. Also, for each i=1,…,99, there is a corridor that connects the (i+1)-th floor of A and the i -th floor of B. You can traverse each of those corridors in both directions, and it takes you x minutes to get to the other end.
Additionally, both of the buildings have staircases. For each 
i=1,…,99, a staircase connects the i-th and (i+1)-th floors of a building, and you need y minutes to get to an adjacent floor by taking the stairs.

Find the minimum time needed to reach the b-th floor of B from the a-th floor of A.
