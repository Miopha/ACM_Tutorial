A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers (a,b,c) such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to a, b and c, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is (3,4,5).

Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: c=a2−b.

Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple (3,4,5): 5=32−4, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.

When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers (a,b,c) with 1≤a≤b≤c≤n such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1≤n≤109).

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of triples of integers (a,b,c) with 1≤a≤b≤c≤n such that they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the formula Vasya came up with.

 * 由c^2=a^2+b^2和c=a^2-b得a^2=2*b+1（故a不能取1且是奇数）再代入得c=b+1
 * c<=n得b<=n-1得a^2<=2*n-1，这时问题变成有多少a满足条件，又因为a不能取1且a是奇数所以满足条件的a有(sqrt(2*n-1)-1)/2个
